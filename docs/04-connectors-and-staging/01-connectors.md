# Connectors

Check out the Medicare Claims Connector on GitHub [here](https://github.com/tuva-health/medicare_claims_connector)

## Description
The Medicare Claims Connector takes raw claims data in the Medicare CCLF format and transforms it into the Tuva Project [Claims Data Model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NuMEhcx6D6MSyZEQ6yk0LWU0HLvaeVma8S-5zhOnbcE/edit?usp=sharing).  Once claims data has been transformed into the Claims Data Model the entire Tuva Project can be run automatically.  

CMS delivers Medicare CCLF claims data to organizations participating in MSSP, Direct Contracting, and ACO REACH programs.  The data is typically delivered as fixed-width flat files as defined in the following [data dictionary](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/cclf-file-data-elements-resource.pdf).  The Medicare Claims Connector assumes that these fixed-width flat files have already been loaded into a data warehouse.

## Video Tutorial
The following video demonstrates how to run the Medicare Claims Connector on Medicare CCLF claims data in Snowflake.
