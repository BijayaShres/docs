 The **Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)** is a composite measure designed to identify communities that may need support before, during, or after hazardous events. The SVI uses 158 variables, grouped into 15 measures, which are further organized into 4 overarching themes. The combined score of these themes forms the overall SVI score.

**SVI Themes:**
1. Socioeconomic Status
2. Household Composition & Disability
3. Racial & Ethnic Minority Status
4. Housing Type & Transportation

### Area Deprivation Index (ADI)

The **Area Deprivation Index (ADI)**, developed by the University of Wisconsin, is a composite measure of socioeconomic status. It incorporates variables such as income, education, employment, and housing quality. The ADI is calculated for each census tract in the United States and grouped into decilesâ€”lower deciles indicate more affluent areas. ADI provides both nationwide and state-ranked scores.

Due to licensing restrictions, we cannot host the ADI data. You can access the ADI dataset [here](https://www.neighborhoodatlas.medicine.wisc.edu/).
