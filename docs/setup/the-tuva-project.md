We recently launched a new tutorial of the Tuva Project which you can access on [GitHub](https://github.com/tuva-health/tuva_claims_demo).  Follow the readme to run the Tuva Project in its entirety on synthethic claims data (the data is part of the GitHub repo). 

In order to run the Tuva Project on your claims data, you first need to map your claims data to the Tuva Claims Data Model (CDM).  Claims data comes in variety of formats.  Some formats will be more straightforward to map to the Tuva CDM than others.  Check out our [mapping guide](../appendix/mapping-guide.md) for tips and best practices for mapping your claims data to the Tuva CDM.  You can also reach out to us on Slack for help.
