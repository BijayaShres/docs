## Overview

Conducting analysis of acute inpatient stays in claims data can be complex, in no small part because the concept of an acute inpatient stay can be found nowhere in raw claims data.  This guide describes how to perform analysis of acute inpatient stays using raw claims data.

The process involves four main steps:

1. Tag Acute Inpatient Claims
2. Group Acute Inpatient Claims into Stays
3. Prepare Analytics-ready Data Table
4. Perform Analysis

In each of the first 3 steps we perform data quality analysis to check for issues in the raw claims data which may impact analysis.

All of the code to compute the first 3 steps is part of the Tuva Project.  In fact, if you follow our Claims Preprocessing guide, you can skip to step 4.
