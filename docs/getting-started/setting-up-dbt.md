# Setting Up dbt

This section provides an overview of dbt and how to set it up in order to run the Tuva Project.

## What is dbt?

[dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) is an open source framework and execution engine for doing data transformation inside of a data warehouse.  The framework incorporates software development best practices such as test-driven development and version control into data engineering (which has historically lacked these practices).

We created [this overview](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17gXDpjIFFNArqvTZl4vSp_KMlDcpFVHkRJC7edEUZXc/edit?usp=sharing) to explain why dbt is a critical part of the modern data platform and how it can help healthcare data teams in particular.

## Installing dbt

dbt provides great documentation on how to get started [here](https://docs.getdbt.com/tutorial/getting-started).
