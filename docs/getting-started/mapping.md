title: "Mapping Your Claims Data"
---
In order to run the Tuva Project on your claims data, you first need to map your claims data to the Tuva Claims Common Data Model (CDM).  Claims data comes in variety of formats.  Some formats will be more straightforward to map to the Tuva Claims CDM than others.  In the coming weeks, we will publish a guide to help users map their claims data.  You can also post on Slack for help mapping your data.
