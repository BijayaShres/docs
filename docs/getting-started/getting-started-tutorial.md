# Getting Started Tutorial

This tutorial is for users to test out and run the Tuva Project from beginning to end.  It uses a set of high-fidelity synthetic healthcare datasets that we developed in partnership with [Syntegra](https://www.syntegra.io/).  These datasets are open and free to download and use.

There are 5 synthetic datasets available for download [here](https://www.syntegra.io/try-syntegra-data).  The steps to run the tutorial are slightly different for each dataset because the formats of each dataset are different and the connectors needed to process each dataset are different.  

This tutorial shows users how to run the Tuva Project using [AWS Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/).  In the coming days we will release companion tutorials for [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/) and [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery).
