Palliative Care is a type of care that patients can receive when they have a terminal disease.  Palliative care is considered comfort care with or without curative intent, and so is closely related to hospice care.

## Key Questions
- How do you identify patients that are (or have been) in palliative care? [^1]
- Can you predict which patients are good candidates for palliative care? [^2]
