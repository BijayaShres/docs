Analysis of emergency department visits is a very common use of claims data.  However, calculating emergency department visits from claims data is non-trivial because a single visit is typically comprised of many claims and there is no field available to link these claims.

## Key Questions
- How do you identify ED visits in claims data? [^1] [^2]
- How do you identify ED visits that ultimately led to admission?
- How do you identify chemotherapy-related ED visits? [^3]
- How do you identify potentially preventable emergency department visits? [^4] [^5]
- What percent of patients die within 7 days of being discharged from the ED and what are the main causes of death? [^6]
