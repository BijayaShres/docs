Analysis of acute inpatient visits is one of the most common uses of claims data.  Many hospital measures, such as length of stay, mortality, and readmission rates all rely on this concept.  However, calculating acute inpatient visits from claims data is non-trivial because a single acute inpatient visit is typically comprised of many claims and there is no field available to link these claims.
