# Claims Input Layer
Claims Input Layer is a general purpose claims data model that's part of the Tuva Project.  We designed it based on our work with dozens of claims datasets, from Medicare to Medicaid to commericial claims datasets.  We call it Claims Input Layer because once your claims data source has been mapped to it you can automatically run any other part of the Tuva Project.  For example, you can automatically run claims preprocessing, data profiling, readmissions, chronic conditions, etc.

Claims Input Layer was designed with two goals in mind:
1. Make it simple to map claims datasets to Claims Input Layer
2. Support a wide variety of downstream healthcare analytics use cases, such as health economics and outcomes research and value-based care analytics

Below is an overview of Claims Input Layer.  The data model includes 3 main tables: **eligibility**, **medical_claim**, and **rx_claim**.

## Eligibility

### Description
The eligibility table includes information about a patient's (note: we use the word patient as a synonym for member) health insurance coverage and demographics.  Every claims dataset should include some sort of eligibility data, otherwise it's impossible to calculate member months, which are needed to calculate measures like PMPM.

### Mapping Guidelines
Insurance eligibility information is usually formatted in 1 of 2 ways: 

- **Coverage Format:** Every patient has a single record per eligibility span (i.e. eligibility start and end date).  The span can be for a single month or for multiple months.
- **Member Months Format:** Every patient has one record for every month of eligibility for every type of insurance product.  For example, if a patient had 12 months of medical coverage they would have 12 records, one for each month of eligibility.

The eligibility table in Claims Input Layer uses the member months format.  If your eligibility data is already in this format then you can map it directly (i.e. very little transformation should be needed).  However if your data is in the coverage format you will first need to transform it into member months before it can be mapped.

**Unique Patient ID:** Ensure this ID uniquely identifies an individual patient in the dataset.

**Demographic Fields:** Ensure these fields (e.g. gender) have been normalized to the appropriate terminologies.  For each field that has a "yes" for normalized terminology in the table below, you can click the link to see the exact terminology values.

### Data Dictionary
| Column | Data Type | Normalized Terminology | Description |
|---|:---:|:---:|---|
| patient_id | varchar | no | Unique identifier for each patient (i.e. member) in the dataset |

| month | int | no | Indicates the month of eligibility for the given patient |
| year | int | no | Indicates the year of eligibility for the given patient |

## Medical Claim

### Description
The medical_claim table contains information on healthcare services and supplies provided to patients, billed by providers, and paid for by health insurers.  It includes information on the provider who rendered the service, the amount paid for the service by the health insurer, and the underlying reason for the service (i.e. diagnosis).  

### Mapping Guidelines
The medical_claim table is at the claim-line grain i.e. it has one record per claim-line.  It combines professional claims (i.e. services billed on a CMS-1500 claim form typically by physicians) and institutional claims (i.e. services billed on a UB-04 claim form typically by hospitals or other institutions) into a single table.  

A typical medical claims dataset includes claims header information and claims line information.  Header information (e.g. DRG) only occurs once per claim whereas line information (e.g. revenue code) may occur many times per claim.  Some claims datasets have header and line information separated into distinct tables while other datasets have the information combined into a single table.  When you combine header and line information into a single table you need to repeat the values of the header data elements for every line on the claim.
