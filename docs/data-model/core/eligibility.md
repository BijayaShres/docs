## Description
The eligibility table includes information about a patient's health insurance coverage and demographics (note: we use the word patient as a synonym for member).  Every claims dataset should include some sort of eligibility data, otherwise it's impossible to calculate member months, which are needed to calculate measures like PMPM.
