# Why Open Source?

The basic problem is that healthcare knowledge and data infrastructure is closed. 

Today, knowledge is closed and institutional.  Try Googling almost any topic in healthcare data and see how far you get.  In addition, there is no place practitioners can congregate to learn from each other.  

Today, healthcare data infrastructure is closed.  Either your company (vendor, health system, payer, pharma, etc.) is building this from scratch or paying a vendor who built it from scratch to deliver it to you in a black-box form for hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars.  

That's why open source is key to how we solve this problem.  By making knowledge and data infrastructure open, we give individuals and organizations a platform they can build on and grow.  We can stop the cycle of building the same thing over and over.

The last few years we've seen a revolution in open source data tools, including [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/), [great_expectations](https://greatexpectations.io/), and [Airbyte](https://airbyte.com/).  It's time for healthcare to catch up.
