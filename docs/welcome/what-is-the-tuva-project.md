# What is the Tuva Project?

The Tuva Project is an open source knowledge-base, code-base, and community for healthcare data practitioners.  The project was started by Aaron Neiderhiser and Coco Zuloaga.  After working in healthcare data science for more than a decade they became frustrated by what they saw as a lack of progress in the field.  From their standpoint, they saw every healthcare data engineer and data scientist solving the same problems over and over again with almost zero improvement in terms of data empowering better treatment and care delivery decisions.  

After thinking about it deeply, they realized healthcare data practitioners were being held back by one main fundamental problem: knowledge.  Compared to other disciplines, doing healthcare data engineering and data science requires a tremendous amount of healthcare domain knowledge.  This comes up in almost every facet of the work we do: building measures and cohorts, pre-processing claims, normalizing lab data, stratifying high-risk patients.  A data practitioner needs knowledge not only about how to do these things but also about the underlying data.  

Where does this knowledge live today?  It's institutional knowledge within healthcare analytics companies and healthcare data teams.  Those of us who have been in the industry long enough have had the experience of trying to learn something knew only to be told that we should "go talk to Susie on team X who's been with the company for 20 years and is the resident expert on the topic."

What's the problem with institutional knowledge?  It's hidden and not accessible to everyone, so it doesn't scale.  As an industry we end up learning the same things over and over.

The Tuva Project was created to bring this knowledge out into the open.  It includes 3 main components:

- [**Knowledge**](https://thetuvaproject.com/docs/intro): An open repository of healthcare domain knowledge for how to work with healthcare data (this site is the Knowledge Base).

- [**Code**](https://github.com/tuva-health): An open library of healthcare data infrastructure including data pre-processing pipelines, common data models and terminologies, and data marts.  We're translating healthcare knowledge into code so data practitioners can stop reinventing the wheel and focus on higher-leverage problems.

- [**Community**](https://join.slack.com/t/thetuvaproject/shared_invite/zt-16iz61187-G522Mc2WGA2mHF57e0il0Q): An open community where healthcare data practitioners can go to get answers to difficult healthcare data problems, learn about the latest trends in healthcare data and network about career opportunities.

The goal of the Knowledge Base and Community is to move the industry from institutional knowledge to open knowledge.  The goal of the Code Base is to give healthcare data practitioners a foundation of healthcare data infrastructure tools they can build on.

Notice the emphasis on "open".  Turns out the right way to build all of this is open source...
