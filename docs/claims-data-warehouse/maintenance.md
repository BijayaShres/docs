In this section we're documenting best practices and tips for maintaining a claims data warehouse.  There are two scenarios where maintenance becomes relevant:

1. Regular data refreshes (e.g. you have a claims dataset that is refreshing each month)
2. Data model changes (e.g. you're iteratively improving your data models and therefore have version/governance challenges, which we consider maintenance)
