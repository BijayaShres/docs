The eligible/enrolled population of patients in a given health insurance plan is always changing.  Patients gain and lose health insurance eligibility for a variety of reasons, including changes in employment, birth, and death.  It's important to normalize spend and utilization measures for these eligibility changes.  Normalizing for patient population changes involves computing member months.
