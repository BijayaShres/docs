The most common way to measure healthcare spend is via a method called PMPM or per-member-per-month.  Analyzing spend on a PMPM-basis normalizes for changes in the enrolled patient population that occur over time, which can bias spend analysis.  

## Key Questions

- How should a claim be attributed to a member month?  Is claim_start_date better than claim_end_date?
- How do you calculate total PMPM and PMPM broken out by medical and pharmacy claims?
- How do you calculate PMPM rates for acute inpatient and emergency department visits?
