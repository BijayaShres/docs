## Acute Inpatient
Analysis of acute inpatient visits is one of the most common uses of claims data.  Many hospital measures, such as length of stay, mortality, and readmission rates all rely on this concept.  However, calculating acute inpatient visits from claims data is non-trivial because a single acute inpatient visit is typically comprised of many claims and there is no field available to link these claims.

**Key Questions**
- How do you identify acute inpatient visits in claims data?
- Which patients are most likely to have a an acute inpatient visit?
- Which patients were discharged to SNFs and which SNF they were discharged to?

## Emergency Department

**Key Questions**
- How do you identify ED visits in claims data?
- How do you identify ED visits that ultimately led to admission?
- How do you identify chemotherapy-related ED visits?
- How do you identify potentially preventable emergency department visits?
- What percent of patients die within 7 days of being discharged from the ED and what are the main causes of death?

## Palliative Care
Palliative Care is a type of service that patients can receive when they have a terminal disease.  Palliative care is considered comfort care with or without curative intent, and so is closely related to hospice care.

**Key Questions**
- How do you identify patients that are (or have been) in palliative care? 
- Can you predict which patients are good candidates for palliative care?
