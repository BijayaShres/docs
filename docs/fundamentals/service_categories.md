Grouping claims into higher-level categories can be a useful tool for analyzing claims cost.  The goal is to group claims into similar categories that match the actual service the claim was for.  A key component of any grouper is to ensure the categorization is both mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning every claim belongs to one and only one category.
