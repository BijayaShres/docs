# Welcome

We're building the open source data transformation layer for healthcare data.

## What Is The Tuva Project

The Tuva Project is a set of open source tools for cleaning and transforming healthcare data.  Cleaning and transforming healthcare data requires many different healthcare-specific data tools, including things like:

- Common Data Model(s)
- Data Curation
- Data Quality Testing
- Groupers
- Measures
- Patient Identity
- Terminology

We've seen healthcare data teams, including ourselves, build these tools from scratch over and over again.  We're open sourcing all of these tools so healthcare data teams can move faster to generate high-quality healthcare data capable of answering important questions that will improve care efficiency and efficacy for patients.

## Who is Tuva Health

Tuva Health is the for-profit company behind the Tuva Project.  We're a team of healthcare data engineers and data scientists totally focused on solving the messy healthcare data problem by bringing knowledge and code out into the open.  Being a for-profit company is extremely important to the long-term success of our mission because it enables us to make significantly larger R+D investments in the open source over time compared to a not-for-profit corporate structure.  The larger investment increases the probability that we'll achieve our mission of solving this problem for the entire industry.

Our business model is to support organizations in adopting the Tuva Project.  The Tuva Project is open source and licensed under Apache 2.  Individuals and organizations are free to try out, adopt, or fork (customize) any part of the Tuva Project for any reason.  However some organizations need help adopting the Tuva Project, either because they lack the expertise or people to implement it.  That's where we come in.  We do everything from helping organizations get up and running to fully managing the Tuva Project for them, all within their cloud environment.

## Why the Name Tuva

The name Tuva is a reference to the country of Tuva in the former Soviet Union.  For more than a decade before his death, [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) and his friend [Ralph Leighton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Leighton) tried to travel to the country of Tuva.  During the cold war getting visas for this journey was no easy feat.  Ultimately Feynman died a few weeks before their visas came, but Ralph traveled to Tuva and chronicled the trip and their adventure trying to get there in his book [Tuva or Bust](https://www.amazon.com/Tuva-Bust-Richard-Feynmans-Journey/dp/0393320693).

We're massive Feynman fans and especially appreciate his strong values around intellectual honesty and curiousity.  We believe these values and behavior are at the core of doing anything important in the world and we're centering the Tuva Project around them.  

Healthcare data has been challenging to work with since the inception of claims data in the mid-90s.  The Tuva Project is our attempt to fix it - Tuva or Bust.
