# Welcome

If you want to learn more about healthcare data and how to work with it, you've come to the right place!

## What is the Tuva Project?

The Tuva Project is an open source knowledge-base, code-base, and community for healthcare data practitioners.  The project was started by Aaron Neiderhiser and Coco Zuloaga.  After working in healthcare data science for more than a decade they became frustrated by what they saw as a lack of progress in the field.  From their standpoint, they saw healthcare data engineers and data scientists solving the same problems over and over again with little improvement in terms of data empowering better treatment and care delivery decisions.  

They realized healthcare data practitioners were being held back by one main fundamental problem: knowledge.  Compared to other disciplines, doing healthcare data engineering and data science requires a tremendous amount of domain knowledge.  This comes up in almost every facet of the work we do: building measures and cohorts, pre-processing claims and lab data, stratifying high-risk patients.  A data practitioner needs knowledge not only about how to do these things but also about the underlying data.  

Where does this knowledge live today?  It's institutional knowledge that lives within healthcare analytics companies and healthcare data teams.  Most of us who have been in the industry long enough have had the experience of trying to learn something knew only to be told that we should "go talk to Susie on team X who's been with our company for 20 years and is the resident expert on the topic."

What's the problem with institutional knowledge?  It's hidden and not accessible to everyone, so it doesn't scale.  As an industry we end up learning the same things over and over.

The Tuva Project was created to bring this knowledge out into the open.  It includes 3 main components:

- [**Knowledge**](https://thetuvaproject.com/docs/intro): A collection of healthcare domain knowledge for how to work with healthcare data.

- [**Code**](https://github.com/tuva-health): An open repository of code and datasets to profile, normalize, and enrich raw healthcare data so it's ready for analytics.

- [**Community**](https://join.slack.com/t/thetuvaproject/shared_invite/zt-16iz61187-G522Mc2WGA2mHF57e0il0Q): An open community where healthcare data practitioners can learn from each other about the best way to tackle different healthcare data problems.

The goal of Knowledge and Community is to move the industry from institutional knowledge to open knowledge.  The goal of Code is to give healthcare data practitioners a foundation of healthcare data infrastructure tools they can build on so we can all stop re-inventing the wheel.

## Why Open Source?

The basic problem is that healthcare knowledge and data infrastructure is closed.

Today, healthcare knowledge is closed and institutional.  Try Googling almost any topic in healthcare data and see how far you get.  In addition, there is no place practitioners can congregate to learn from each other.  

Today, healthcare data infrastructure is closed.  Your company (vendor, health system, payer, pharma, etc.) is building this from scratch or paying a vendor who built it from scratch to deliver it to you in a black-box form for hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars.  

That's why open source is key to how we solve this problem.  By making healthcare knowledge and data infrastructure open, we give individuals and organizations a platform they can build on and grow over time.  And we stop the cycle of building the same thing over and over.

The last few years we've seen a revolution in open source data tools, including [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/), [great_expectations](https://greatexpectations.io/), and [Airbyte](https://airbyte.com/).  It's time for healthcare to catch up.

## Who is Tuva Health?

Tuva Health is the for-profit company behind the Tuva Project.  We're a team of healthcare data engineers and data scientists totally focused on solving the messy healthcare data problem by bringing knowledge and code out into the open.  Being a for-profit company is extremely important to the long-term success of our mission because it enables us to make significantly larger R+D investments in the open source over time compared to a not-for-profit corporate structure.  The larger investment increases the probability that we'll achieve our mission of solving this problem for the entire industry.

Our business model is to support organizations in adopting the Tuva Project.  The Tuva Project is open source and licensed under Apache 2.  Individuals and organizations are free to try out, adopt, or fork (customize) any part of the Tuva Project for any reason.  However some organizations need help adopting the Tuva Project, either because they lack the expertise or people to implement it.  That's where we come in.  We do everything from helping organizations get up and runniing to fully managing the Tuva Project for them, all within their cloud environment.

## Why the Name Tuva?

The name Tuva is a reference to the country of Tuva in the former Soviet Union.  For more than a decade before his death, Richard Feynman and his friend Ralph Leighton tried to travel to the country of Tuva.  During the cold war this was no easy feat.  Ultimately Feynman died a few weeks before their visas came, but Ralph traveled to Tuva and chronicled the trip and their adventure trying to get there in his book [Tuva or Bust](https://www.amazon.com/Tuva-Bust-Richard-Feynmans-Journey/dp/0393320693).

We're massive Feynman fans and especially appreciate his strong values around intellectual honesty.  We believe these values and behavior are at the core of doing anything important in the world and we're centering the Tuva Project around them.  

Healthcare data has been challenging to work with since inception of claims data in the mid-90s.  The Tuva Project is our attempt to fix it - Tuva or Bust.
