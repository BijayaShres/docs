# Welcome

If you want to learn more about healthcare data and how to work with it, you've come to the right place!

## What is the Tuva Project?

The Tuva Project is an open source knowledge-base, code-base, and community for healthcare data practitioners.  The project was started by Aaron Neiderhiser and Coco Zuloaga.  After working in healthcare data science for more than a decade they became frustrated by what they saw as a lack of progress in the field.  From their standpoint, they saw every healthcare data engineer and data scientist solving the same problems over and over again with almost zero improvement in terms of data empowering better treatment and care delivery decisions.  

After thinking about it deeply, they realized healthcare data practitioners were being held back by one main fundamental problem: knowledge.  Compared to other disciplines, doing healthcare data engineering and data science requires a tremendous amount of healthcare domain knowledge.  This comes up in almost every facet of the work we do: building measures and cohorts, pre-processing claims, normalizing lab data, stratifying high-risk patients.  A data practitioner needs knowledge not only about how to do these things but also about the underlying data.  

Where does this knowledge live today?  It's institutional knowledge within healthcare analytics companies and healthcare data teams.  Those of us who have been in the industry long enough have had the experience of trying to learn something knew only to be told that we should "go talk to Susie on team X who's been with the company for 20 years and is the resident expert on the topic."

What's the problem with institutional knowledge?  It's hidden and not accessible to everyone, so it doesn't scale.  As an industry we end up learning the same things over and over.

The Tuva Project was created to bring this knowledge out into the open.  It includes 3 main components:

- [**Knowledge**](https://thetuvaproject.com/docs/intro): An open repository of healthcare domain knowledge for how to work with healthcare data (this site is the Knowledge Base).

- [**Code**](https://github.com/tuva-health): An open library of healthcare data infrastructure including data pre-processing pipelines, common data models and terminologies, and data marts.  We're translating healthcare knowledge into code so data practitioners can stop reinventing the wheel and focus on higher-leverage problems.

- [**Community**](https://join.slack.com/t/thetuvaproject/shared_invite/zt-16iz61187-G522Mc2WGA2mHF57e0il0Q): An open community where healthcare data practitioners can go to get answers to difficult healthcare data problems, learn about the latest trends in healthcare data and network about career opportunities.

The goal of the Knowledge Base and Community is to move the industry from institutional knowledge to open knowledge.  The goal of the Code Base is to give healthcare data practitioners a foundation of healthcare data infrastructure tools they can build on.

Notice the emphasis on "open".  Turns out the right way to build all of this is open source...

## Why Open Source?

The basic problem is that healthcare knowledge and data infrastructure is closed. 

Today, knowledge is closed and institutional.  Try Googling almost any topic in healthcare data and see how far you get.  In addition, there is no place practitioners can congregate to learn from each other.  

Today, healthcare data infrastructure is closed.  Either your company (vendor, health system, payer, pharma, etc.) is building this from scratch or paying a vendor who built it from scratch to deliver it to you in a black-box form for hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars.  

That's why open source is key to how we solve this problem.  By making knowledge and data infrastructure open, we give individuals and organizations a platform they can build on and grow.  We can stop the cycle of building the same thing over and over.

The last few years we've seen a revolution in open source data tools, including [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/), [great_expectations](https://greatexpectations.io/), and [Airbyte](https://airbyte.com/).  It's time for healthcare to catch up.

## Who is Tuva Health?

Tuva Health is the for-profit company behind the Tuva Project.  We're a team of healthcare data engineers and data scientists totally focused on solving the messy healthcare data problem.  Being a for-profit company is extremely important to the long-term success of our mission because over time it allows us to make significantly larger R+D investments in the open source.  The larger investment substantially increases the probability that we'll achieve our mission of solving this problem for the entire industry.

Our business model is to support organizations in adopting the Tuva Project.  The Tuva Project is open source and licensed under Apache 2.  Individuals and organizations are free to try out, adopt, or fork (customize) any part of the Tuva Project for any reason.  However some organizations need help adopting the Tuva Project, either because they lack the expertise or people to implement it.  That's where we come in.  We do everything from helping organizations get up and runniing to fully managing the Tuva Project for them, all within their cloud environment.


## Why the Name Tuva?

The name Tuva is a reference to the country of Tuva in the former Soviet Union.  For more than a decade before his death, Richard Feynman and his friend Ralph Leighton tried to travel to the country of Tuva.  During the cold war this was no easy feat.  Ultimately Feynman died a few weeks before their visas came, but Ralph traveled to Tuva and chronicled the trip and their adventure trying to get there in the book Tuva or Bust.

We're massive Feynman fans and especially appreciate his strong values around intellectual honesty and truth-seeking behavior.  We believe these values and behavior are at the core of doing anything important in the world.  

Healthcare data has been broken since it's inception in the mid-90s.  The Tuva Project is our attempt to fix it - Tuva or Bust.
