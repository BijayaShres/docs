Core is a collection of tables that include what we consider to be the core concepts needed for healthcare analytics.  This includes concepts like patient, provider, encounter (i.e. visit), condition, etc.  It also includes tables for claims data-specific concepts (e.g. medical_claim).  The claims data tables are similar to the Input Layer but have been enhanced with terminology and groupers from Claims Preprocessing.

You can use Core to answer simple questions (e.g. how many patients are in my dataset).  Core also powers downstream data marts that contain higher-level concepts and data quality tests.
