# Data Sources

This section describes the types of healthcare data sources the Tuva Project works with.  There are two types of healthcare data formats: standard and non-standard.  We provide an overview of how the Tuva Project works with standard and non-standard formats below.

Additionally there are many different types of healthcare data sources.  The two main types the Tuva Project currently works with are claims data and medical record data.

## Standard Data Formats

Standard data formats are typically maintained by a governing organization and follow a well-specified schema.  A well-specified schema explains precisely the tables and columns that are allowed in the data format.  Because the schema is well-specified for standard formats, we can build connectors that directly take healthcare data in standard formats and connect them to the rest of the Tuva Project.

Here is a list of the standard data formats we currently support.

| Data Source | Maintaining Organization | Tuva Connector on GitHub |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Medicare CCLF Claims Data](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/cclf-file-data-elements-resource.pdf) | CMS | [Medicare CCLF Connector](https://github.com/tuva-health/medicare_cclf_connector) |
| [Medicare SAF Claims Data](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Files-for-Order/LimitedDataSets/StandardAnalyticalFiles) | CMS | [Medicare SAF Connector](https://github.com/tuva-health/medicare_saf_connector) |
| [Flexpa](https://www.flexpa.com/docs) | Flexpa | Under Development |

## Non-standard Data Formats

Unfortunately non-standard data formats are the norm in healthcare.  This is slowly changing thanks to interoperability regulations (Flexpa has a great explanation of these regulations and how they enable patient data access [here](https://www.flexpa.com/docs/guides/patient-access)), but the most common way organizations share data is through non-standard data dumps over SFTP.

What do we mean by "non-standard"?  We mean that the schema (i.e. the tables and columns the data is organized into) is non-standard.  Non-standard formats have all or most the common fields you would expect in healthcare data, but the fields are not organized in a standard schema.

Non-standard formats are incredibly common with both medical record data and claims data.  If you are getting a data dump from a data partner (e.g. payer or provider), chances are they are sending you that data over SFTP in a non-standard (custom) format.

### Claims Input Layer

The Claims Input Layer is a claims data model that's part of the Tuva Project.  Any non-standard claims dataset that has been mapped to the Claims Input Layer will not automatically work with all other parts of the Tuva Project.  The Claims Input Layer can also be used as a common claims data model that you map your non-standard claims datasets to.

Below is an overview of the Claims Input Layer data model.  It includes two main tables: eligibility and medical_claim.  

- **eligibility:** The eligibility table is at the member month grain i.e. it has one record per member per month of eligibility.  
- **medical_claim:** The medical_claim table is at the claim-line grain i.e. it has one record per claim-line.
