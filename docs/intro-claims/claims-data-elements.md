title: "Claims Data Elements"
---
In this section weâ€™ll cover the key data elements on each claims data form.

Each claims form has two sections: a header section and a line section.  Claims forms specify which data elements should be entered in the header section versus the line section.  Every data element in the header section may only be entered a specific number of times (typically one time, but not always).  On the other hand, data elements in the line section may be entered an unlimited number of times.
