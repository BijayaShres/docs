Connectors are dbt packages that map standard data formats to the Tuva Input Layer.  Currently the Tuva Project has two connectors:

- [Medicare LDS Claims Data](https://github.com/tuva-health/medicare_lds_connector)
- [Medicare CCLF Claims Data](https://github.com/tuva-health/medicare_cclf_connector)
