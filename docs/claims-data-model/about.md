title: "Claims Data Model"
---

The Claims Data Model is designed to be a general data model that is simple to map claims data to.  

We are building connectors that map standard healthcare data sources to the Claims Data Model.  Currently the Tuva Project has two connectors:

- [Medicare LDS Claims Data](https://github.com/tuva-health/medicare_lds_connector)
- [Medicare CCLF Claims Data](https://github.com/tuva-health/medicare_cclf_connector)
