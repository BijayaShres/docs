In this section we explore frequently asked claims data analytics questions.  Each question contains an example query that you can run against the Tuva Project data model.  We also provide example results in the form of tables and charts.  There are two primary datasets we use to generate these results:

1. **Tuva Claims Demo:** A synthetic claims dataset which you can access via any of our data shares on Snowflake, AWS, or Google BigQuery.  You can read more about how to access these datasets [here](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZT0ZS2I9BQ/tuva-health-tuva-project-claims-demo).

2. **Medicare SAF LDS:** A limited dataset sample of Medicare claims from 2020 which we purchased and are using for research.  You can read more about this dataset [here](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Files-for-Order/LimitedDataSets/StandardAnalyticalFiles).
