Welcome to the Tuva Project!  This is where you can learn what the Tuva Project is and how to use it in your healthcare data platform.

## What is the Tuva Project

The Tuva Project is an open source library of tools for transforming raw healthcare data (e.g. claims, medical records) and doing analytics.  Healthcare data is difficult to analyze with because it requires an insane amount of transformation and enrichment before you can do any data analysis.  Further, significant subject matter expertise is required to know _how_ to properly transform and enrich healthcare data.

For years we've seen healthcare data teams (includidng our former teams) working to solve this problem from scratch.  Unfortunately this is a massive challenge, because it requires a laundry-list of tools: syntatic and semantic normalization, data profiling, reference terminology, measures and groupers, etc.  Some of these tools already exist and are open source.  Unfortunately they are usually written in SAS or not available as code.  We're converting these to code that runs in the modern data platform and we're building the tools that don't yet exist as well.

Our goal is to enable healthcare data teams to generate high-quality analytics faster, and we believe open source is the key to doing that.  The diagram below is our picture of the universe of tools and capabilities that every modern healthcare data platform should have.  The rest of this website describes these tools in detail, including how you can use them in your healthcare data platform.

## Who is Tuva Health

Tuva Health is the for-profit company behind the Tuva Project.  We're a team of healthcare data engineers and data scientists totally focused on solving the messy healthcare data problem.  Being a for-profit company is extremely important to the long-term success of our mission because it enables us to make significantly larger R+D investments in the open source over time compared to a not-for-profit corporate structure.  The larger investment increases the probability that we'll achieve our mission of solving this problem for the entire healthcare industry.

Our business model is to support organizations in adopting the Tuva Project.  The Tuva Project is open source and licensed under Apache 2, one of the most permissive open source licenses.  Individuals and organizations are free to test out, adopt, or fork (customize) any part of the Tuva Project for any reason.  However, some organizations may need or want help setting up the Tuva Project.  That's where we come in.

## Why the Name Tuva

The name Tuva is a reference to the country of Tuva in the former Soviet Union.  For more than a decade before his death, [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) and his friend [Ralph Leighton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Leighton) tried to travel to the country of Tuva.  During the cold war getting visas for this journey was no easy feat.  Ultimately Feynman died a few weeks before their visas came, but Ralph traveled to Tuva and chronicled the trip and their adventure trying to get there in his book [Tuva or Bust](https://www.amazon.com/Tuva-Bust-Richard-Feynmans-Journey/dp/0393320693).

We're massive Feynman fans and especially appreciate his strong values around intellectual honesty and curiousity.  We believe these values and behavior are at the core of doing anything important in the world and we're centering the Tuva Project around them.  

Healthcare data has been challenging to work with since the inception of claims data in the mid-90s.  The Tuva Project is our attempt to fix it - Tuva or Bust.
