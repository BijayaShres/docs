Welcome to the Tuva Project's Knowledge Base!  Knowledge Base is where you can learn about the Tuva Project and how to use it to convert your healthcare data into data ready for analytics and machine learning.

## What is the Tuva Project

The Tuva Project is an open source library of **data models, data marts, terminology sets, and data quality tests** for cleaning and transforming healthcare data so that it's ready for analytics and machine learning.  For years we've seen healthcare data teams (includidng our former teams) building and re-building these healthcare data transformation tools from scratch.  Our goal is to stop re-inventing the wheel and start enabling healthcare data teams to generate high-quality healthcare analytics faster!

## Who is Tuva Health

Tuva Health is the for-profit company behind the Tuva Project.  We're a team of healthcare data engineers and data scientists totally focused on solving the messy healthcare data problem.  Being a for-profit company is extremely important to the long-term success of our mission because it enables us to make significantly larger R+D investments in the open source over time compared to a not-for-profit corporate structure.  The larger investment increases the probability that we'll achieve our mission of solving this problem for the entire healthcare industry.

Our business model is to support organizations in adopting the Tuva Project.  The Tuva Project is open source and licensed under Apache 2, one of the most permissive open source licenses.  Individuals and organizations are free to test out, adopt, or fork (customize) any part of the Tuva Project for any reason.  However, some organizations may need or want help setting up the Tuva Project.  That's where we come in.

## Why the Name Tuva

The name Tuva is a reference to the country of Tuva in the former Soviet Union.  For more than a decade before his death, [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) and his friend [Ralph Leighton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Leighton) tried to travel to the country of Tuva.  During the cold war getting visas for this journey was no easy feat.  Ultimately Feynman died a few weeks before their visas came, but Ralph traveled to Tuva and chronicled the trip and their adventure trying to get there in his book [Tuva or Bust](https://www.amazon.com/Tuva-Bust-Richard-Feynmans-Journey/dp/0393320693).

We're massive Feynman fans and especially appreciate his strong values around intellectual honesty and curiousity.  We believe these values and behavior are at the core of doing anything important in the world and we're centering the Tuva Project around them.  

Healthcare data has been challenging to work with since the inception of claims data in the mid-90s.  The Tuva Project is our attempt to fix it - Tuva or Bust.
