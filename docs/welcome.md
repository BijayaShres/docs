# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

Welcome to the Tuva Project!  We are the community building the future of healthcare analytics -- a future that is open-source, transparent, and accessible by everyone.  We started the Tuva Project because we got tired of building and re-building the same tools over and over.  The main tools are shown in the diagram below.  This website provides full documentation on these tools, including how they work and how to use them.

This video provides a short intro to Tuva to get you up and running.

Doing healthcare analytics requires the tools shown in the diagram above.  By open-sourcing these tools, we aim to:

1. Enable healthcare data teams to re-allocate their time and resources away from re-inventing these tools and instead focus on solving more complex problems
2. Build the best set of tools possible by crowdsourcing improvements from across the industry

These docs describe the tools we've built, how to use them, and the use cases they support.

We offer services to help organizations implement and operate the Tuva Project inside their cloud environment.  [Contact us](https://tuvahealth.com/request-a-demo/) to learn more about how we can help your organization.
